This plugin allows the display and further use of information from fylr databases (fylr.io).

### Description

This plugin allows the display and further use of information from fylr databases (fylr.io). For this purpose, login data (fylr-url, user, password, client ID and client secret) are stored in WordPress. A new field “fylr-uuid” is automatically added to all posts. If a fylr-uuid is inserted in a post, the plugin fetches the information in JSON format the configured fylr. The data is then written to the posts “post_title”, “post_content” and “image” using a template functionality.
